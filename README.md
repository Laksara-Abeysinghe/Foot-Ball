# Foot-Ball

Here I used KAGGLE data set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) which is related to the football. 
There are 18156 players and 48 variables and this data set is valid for up to 2020 worldwide versa. The researcher mainly focused on to the performance ratings of the players. So according to those components I tried to carry out my data analytics and data visualizations parts.
Going through these things I believe that any kind of undergraduater or anybody who like to data science will help this and they will enjoy it.
